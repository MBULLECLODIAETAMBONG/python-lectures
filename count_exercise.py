# write a program in python that 
# 1.Create a variable called `count` and set it to 10.
# 2. Use the `+=` assignment operator to add 5 to the `count` variable.
# 3. Print the value of `count` to the console.
# 4. Use the `-=` assignment operator to subtract 3 from the `count` variable.
# 5. Print the value of `count` to the console.
# 6. Use the `*=` assignment operator to multiply the `count` variable by 2.
# 7. Print the value of `count` to the console.


count = 10
count += 5

# Adding 5 to count
print("Adding 5 to count gives: ",count)

# subtracting 3 from count 
count -= 3
print("subtracting 3 from count gives: ",count)

# Multiplying count by 2 
count *= 2
print("Multiplying count by 2 gives: ",count)
