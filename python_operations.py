# Python Comparism operator: Compares if the left side of the equation is equal to the right side 

x = 10
y = 4

# EQUALITY OPERATOR
print(x==y)

# GREATER THAN OPERATOR
print(y>x)

# GREATER THAN OR EQUALITY TO OPERATOR
print(x>=y)

# LESSER THAN OPERATOR
print(y<x)

# LESSER THAN OR EQUALITY OPERATOR
print(y<=x)

# LOGICAL OPERATOR: it used to compare conditional statement

# AND  operator

# OR operator
print(sandra<funcho or marbel>sandra)

# NOT operator
